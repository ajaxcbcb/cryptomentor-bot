## [2.1.2] — 2026-04-11 — Dashboard Stability, Notification UX, Trade Audio Cues, Data Accuracy

### 🚀 What Changed

#### 1) Dashboard Access and Rendering Stability
- Fixed dashboard render blocker caused by missing `riskSettings` wiring in frontend tabs.
- Added safer defaults and session boot error handling to avoid blank/indefinite loading states.
- Improved verification/session resilience in web login flow and gatekeeper transitions.

#### 2) Portfolio/Engine Risk UI Cleanup
- Removed duplicate **Risk Management** card from Engine Controls.
- Removed Risk Management block from Portfolio Status to prevent layout collisions.
- Kept single canonical risk control surface in Engine Controls.

#### 3) Responsive Layout Hardening
- Fixed resize/overflow issues in Portfolio Status:
  - Better wrapping behavior for header controls.
  - Safer flex shrink behavior (`min-w-0`) in main content.
  - Grid breakpoint tuning to prevent card clipping on medium widths.
  - Horizontal overflow guards added to root/main containers.

#### 4) Branding Update
- Replaced Bitunix branding image with `bitunix.jpg` and updated rendered card usage.

#### 5) Trade Notifications (Telegram, Professional Format)
- Added admin-triggerable web endpoint to send sample trade notifications:
  - `POST /dashboard/admin/broadcast-sample-trades`
  - Supports **trade opened** + **trade closed** messages.
  - Professional emoji-rich formatting and CTA button.
  - Added optional `target_chat_id` for single-user test sends before mass broadcast.
- Sent verified sample open/close notifications to Telegram user `1187119989`.

#### 6) Realized PnL / Closed Trades Accuracy Fix
- Fixed backend trade aggregation that incorrectly filtered only `status = closed`.
- Updated portfolio/performance/leaderboard queries to include real close variants:
  - `closed_tp`, `closed_sl`, `closed_tp1`, `closed_tp2`, `closed_tp3`, `closed_flip`, `closed_manual`.
- Result: 30D realized PnL and closed trade counts now reflect real engine outcomes.

#### 7) Web Sound Effects for Trade Lifecycle
- Added browser-side audio cues in dashboard:
  - Trade Open: ascending chime.
  - Trade Close: descending confirmation tone.
- Implemented with Web Audio API and live position diff detection from polling.
- Includes user-interaction unlock handling for browser autoplay restrictions.

### ✅ Deploy/Verification Notes

1. Frontend was rebuilt and redeployed multiple times with final responsive + audio updates.
2. Backend (`cryptomentor-web.service`) was restarted with notification and PnL-status fixes.
3. Telegram sample notification delivery to `1187119989` returned Telegram API `ok: true` for both open and close messages.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-04-10 — Unified Verification, Anti-Flip Stabilization, StackMentor 1:3, UI Hardening

### 🚀 What Changed

#### 1) Unified Bitunix UID Verification (single source of truth)
- Added centralized verification table migration:
  - `db/verification_access_control.sql`
  - New `user_verifications` with statuses: `pending | approved | rejected`
  - Added indexes, trigger-managed `updated_at`, RLS policies, and legacy backfill from `autotrade_sessions`
- Backend verification routes now use `user_verifications`:
  - `website-backend/app/routes/user.py`
  - Web UID submission writes `pending` + sends Telegram admin inline action buttons
- Verification guard now enforces strict `approved` access only:
  - `website-backend/app/middleware/verification_guard.py`
  - Changed behavior to fail-closed when verification lookup fails (prevents accidental bypass)
- Telegram admin approval handlers now update centralized verification status + admin audit fields:
  - `Bismillah/app/handlers_autotrade_admin.py`
- Telegram UID submit flow now writes to centralized verification and includes inline approve/reject keyboard:
  - `Bismillah/app/handlers_autotrade.py`

#### 2) Anti-Flip / Churn Control for Sideways Trades
- Added stability and anti-flip controls in scalping:
  - `Bismillah/app/scalping_engine.py`
  - Added close dedupe protection, close-lock guard, and idempotent close write path
  - Added consecutive signal confirmation gate before entry
  - Added opposite-direction re-entry block window after close
- Added config knobs:
  - `Bismillah/app/trading_mode.py`
  - `sideways_reentry_cooldown_seconds`
  - `anti_flip_opposite_seconds`
  - `signal_confirmations_required`
  - `signal_confirmation_max_gap_seconds`

#### 3) StackMentor Risk Model Update: Fixed 1:3
- Updated StackMentor to unified fixed target model:
  - `Bismillah/app/stackmentor.py`
  - All trades now target fixed `R:R 1:3`
  - Full position closes at TP (100% at TP1), compatibility fields retained (`tp2/tp3 = tp1`, `qty_tp2/qty_tp3 = 0`)
  - TP hit now finalizes trade status as `closed_tp`

#### 4) Frontend UI Updates
- Added Bitunix logo to API Management/API Bridges card:
  - `website-frontend/src/assets/bitunix-logo.png`
  - `website-frontend/src/App.jsx`
- Disabled unfinished tabs from sidebar and content routing:
  - Performance
  - Skills & Education
  - File: `website-frontend/src/App.jsx`

### ✅ Required Actions After Deploy

1. Run SQL migration in Supabase:
   - `db/verification_access_control.sql`
2. Ensure env vars are set and correct:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
   - `ADMIN_IDS`
3. Redeploy/restart all runtime processes:
   - Telegram bot process
   - Backend API process
   - Frontend app
4. Smoke-test verification flow:
   - Submit UID via web and Telegram -> status becomes `pending`
   - Approve/reject via Telegram admin button -> status updates immediately in Supabase
   - Web trading endpoints allow only `approved`
5. Smoke-test anti-flip behavior:
   - Confirm no rapid opposite-direction re-entry on same symbol within configured block window
6. Smoke-test StackMentor:
   - New trades should show fixed `1:3` target behavior and full close on TP

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-10 — 🚀 Phase 1 & 2 Migration: Bot Gatekeeper & Pro Money Management

**Major Milestone**: Successfully transitioned the Telegram bot from a primary trading interface to a **Web-Dashboard-first Gatekeeper**. All trading features, configuration, and identity verification are now centralized on the web, with the bot serving as a secure onboarding and notification bridge.

### 🚀 Core Changes

#### 🔥 Bot-to-Web Transformation (`Bismillah/`)
- **Refacted Handlers**: `handlers_autotrade.py` converted into a tight **Gatekeeper Flow** (Verified, Pending, Unverified).
- **Simplified Menus**: Telegram menu (`menu_system.py`) reduced to a 3-button model focused on the Web Dashboard.
- **Auto-Login URLs**: Created `app/lib/auth.py` to generate secure JWT-based URLs for seamless bot-to-web redirection.
- **Retired Features**: Manual signals, AI market analysis, and education commands now redirect users to the web dashboard.

#### 🔥 Identity Verification & Security
- **UID Submission**: Native bot-based flow for Bitunix UID submission.
- **Admin Verification**: New `handlers_autotrade_admin.py` allows admins to approve/reject UIDs with one click inside Telegram.
- **Verification Guard**: New backend middleware blocks unverified users from all trading-related endpoints.

#### 🔥 Professional Money Management (Phase 2)
- **Engine Hardening**: `scalping_engine.py` now strictly honors database-persisted **Leverage (1x-20x)** and **Margin Mode (Cross/Isolated)**.
- **Rich Frontend Controls**: Added unified `RiskManagementCard` to the dashboard for fine-grained risk control.
- **Live Equity Sizing**: Risk per trade is now calculated against live Bitunix account equity (Wallet + Unrealized PnL).

#### 🔥 Enhanced Onboarding Flow
- **Onboarding Wizard**: New step-by-step registration and API setup wizard for verified users.
- **Verification Gates**: Frontend screens for UID submission and pending verification status.
- **Referral Integration**: Integrated Bitunix VIP code `sq45` directly into the onboarding registration prompts.

### 🌍 Localization & UX
- Translated Telegram bot welcome screens and onboarding messages to English for global support.
- Added live profit tickers and social proof components to the web dashboard.
- Consolidated bot command responses with consistent redirect messaging.

### Why
- Better UX — web interface is richer than inline keyboards
- Unified platform — one place for all trading management
- Easier maintenance — no duplicate feature implementations
- Aligns with the Bitunix Community Bot model

### What Users Should Do
Use the **web dashboard** for all trading features:
- Portfolio & open positions
- Engine start/stop controls
- Signals & market analysis
- Risk, leverage & margin settings
- Performance metrics & trade history
- API key management
